  <h2>My servers</h2>
  <p>I have 3 of them currently, the first one is a older gaming computer  and the other is 2x Dell Optiplex 3010's. 
  <p>The old gaming computer has a Ryzen 1300x and GTX 1070 FTW with 16GB RAM (2x4gb), the system disk is a 120GB SSD with a 12TB renewed MDD HDD drive.</p>
	<p>The 2 Dell Optiplexs have some low end 3rd gen i7 in them with 120gb SSD's and a 600gb HDD in one of them for security camera recordings.</p>
  <p><span class="highlighted">Services.</span> My old gaming computer runs a PleX server that I co-host with a friend also with a 12TB MDD HDD and we split Movies on mine and Tv Shows on his. One of the Optiplexs I use for my security camera recordings using iSpy. My other optiplex im waiting to put as a relay for the onion router.</p>

      <p><a href="https://radio.arav.su/">radio.arav.su</a>.<a href="http://wsmkgnmhmzqm7kyzv7jnzzafvgm7xlmlfvzhgorpapd5or2arnhuktqd.onion/">onion</a>.<a href="http://radio.arav.i2p/">i2p</a>.<a href="http://[300:a98d:d6d0:8a08::e]/">ygg</a></p>
      <p>Runs using Liquidsoap through Icecast, which goes through NGiNX. I broadcast almost everything I have. Sorry, but I'm too lazy to make some kind of broadcasting program to stream so I just randomise the playlist and throw new music there from time to time.</p>
      <p>This project grew from MPD I used to stream music over LAN for myself. Then I let it out and placed a player on my Neocities website. Then Icecast was added to see if there are listeners. I wasn't happy on how MPD was nearly overloading CPU, and later, after moving the radio off to a laptop, MPD was replaced by Liquidsoap.</p>

      <p>It is set to use 8 MBits of my Internet connection. It cannot became a guard node because of dynamic IP-address.</p>
      <p><b>Since 1st December 2021 Tor is blocked in Russia, so the relay is down.</b></p>

  <h2>Private services</h2>
  <p class="center">That are available for a narrow circle of people.</p>
  <div class="columns">
    <div>
      <h3 class="service-up">E-Mail server</h3>
      <p>Postfix, Dovecot (w/Sieve), Spamassassin, ClamAV, OpenDMARC and OpenDKIM.</p>
      <p>Alas, I don't have a static IP. And there is not much sense in it because my ISP doesn't offer reverse DNS for regular clients (it'd be bloody awesome).</p>
      <p>It results in my messages ends up in a spam box at best. Well, Yandex, Google, Microsoft Live, and Rambler lets me in an Inbox. :) But if service use Spamhaus' blocklists then I'm being rejected.</p>
      <p><b>TLDR; I may not be able to send a reply</b>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="service-up">XMPP/Jabber</h3>
      <p>Prosody.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="service-down">Mumble</h3>
      <p><a href="mumble://arav.su">mumble://arav.su</a></p>
      <p>It's private, but you still can join an entrance room where you can only write messages. A certificate is necessary.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="service-down">TeamSpeak 3</h3>
      <p><a href="ts3server://arav.su">ts3server://arav.su</a></p>
      <p>Same as with Mumble applies to TS. It's security level is set to 29, so is yours identifier's level should be at least that high.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Game servers</h3>
      <p>All game servers are private, if there's exception I'll mention it in its description. They are listed in a section below.</p>
      <p>Some servers are listed in an in-game server list and theirs names looks like “Arav's dwelling / &lt;Game name&gt;”.</p>
      <p>And, of course, I don't run them simultaneously and start them only when needed.</p>
      <p>Expect poor performance because the server is a low-end laptop.</p>
